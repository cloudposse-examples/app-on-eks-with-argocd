# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Example Dockerized application deployed on EKS with Helmfile.

usage: |-
  We've consolidated all the workflows, including the shared/resuable [GitHub reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows). We've done this to make it easier for Developers to understand how the example leverages all the workflows. In practice, we recommend moving the reusable workflows into a centralized repository, where they can be shared by other application repositories.
  
  For example, from this example we would recommend moving all the `eks-argocd-*` and all `workflow-*` workflow files to a centralized repository (e.g. a respository named `github-action-workflows`). The best solution will depend on your GitHub organization structure and team size. Pick what works for you and your team.
